''2dEngine''
================

This is a project that I have had in mind for a while.

The purpose of this project is hopefully to create an engine that I can use for making 2d games.

This is also kind of a project that I am also building just to have it look good on a resume.
A lot of time and research has been put into this as a sort of showcase of different programming styles and areas.

There are some cool numbers in cloc.txt, it contains a count of code lines and such.

''Please'' if there are any questions about this project, or how you can contribute, or even just questions in general about anything, feel free to email me at gabriel.k.sorensen%at%gmail.com and I will get to them as fast as possible.
